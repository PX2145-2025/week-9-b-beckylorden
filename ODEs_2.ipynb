        "[4] Use your function to solve the 2D equations of motion for a circular orbit. For simplicity, you can set $G = 1$ and $M = 1$. Calculate the time period for one orbit and integrate the equations for a few (say two) periods, and 100 points, and plot the (x,y) motion. Does this look like what you expect? How does this change if N is 200 and 400? (Plot all in one figure.)\n",

Choose some separation, and some initial position (for example, $r = 10$ and $x(0) = 10$ and $y(0) = 0$). Then calculate the theoretical value of $\\omega$ for a circular orbit, and hence the appropriate initial values of $v_x(0)$ and $v_y(0)$. Note that the velocity vector will be perpendicular to the position vector for a circular orbit. You can work out what the time period $T$ is for one orbit, and choose a time step a multiple of $\\Delta t = T/100$ etc.\n"
